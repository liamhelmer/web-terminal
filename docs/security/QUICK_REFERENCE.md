## 🔥 Top 5 Critical Issues

### 1. No Process Sandboxing (VULN-003)

**CVSS:** 9.6 (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** PTY processes run with server privileges, no isolation

**Location:** `src/pty/process.rs`

**Fix Time:** 7 days

**Action:**
```bash
# Implement Linux namespaces and cgroups
# See REMEDIATION_PLAN.md Phase 1, Days 1-7
```

---

### 2. Path Traversal in Session State (VULN-015)

**CVSS:** 9.1 (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Inadequate path validation allows escape from workspace directory

**Location:** `src/session/state.rs:176`

**Fix Time:** 1 hour

**Action:**
```bash
# Apply path-traversal-fix.patch immediately
# See REMEDIATION_PLAN.md Phase 1, Day 1
```

---

### 3. No Rate Limiting (VULN-004)

**CVSS:** 8.8 (HIGH)

**Problem:** Missing rate limiting allows DoS attacks

**Location:** `src/server/middleware.rs`

**Fix Time:** 3 days

**Action:**
```bash
# Implement functional rate limiting
# See REMEDIATION_PLAN.md Phase 2, Days 8-10
```

---

### 4. Insufficient JWT Validation (VULN-005)

**CVSS:** 8.6 (HIGH)

**Problem:** JWT validation incomplete, missing algorithm verification and JWKS refresh

**Location:** `src/security/auth.rs`

**Fix Time:** 3 days

**Action:**
```bash
# Enhance JWT validation per spec-kit
# See REMEDIATION_PLAN.md Phase 2, Days 11-13
```

---

### 5. Command Injection Risk (VULN-013)

**CVSS:** 8.5 (HIGH)

**Problem:** No command validation before PTY execution

**Location:** `src/pty/process.rs`

**Fix Time:** 4 hours

```bash
# Implement command validator
# See REMEDIATION_PLAN.md Phase 2, Day 8
```

1. **Fix CRITICAL vulnerabilities first** (10 days)
2. **Don't deploy without approval** (security team)
3. **Test everything thoroughly** (100% coverage)

### Key Success Factors

✅ Follow the remediation plan exactly
✅ Test after every fix
✅ Document all changes
✅ Communicate progress weekly
✅ Don't skip security reviews

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ Rushing fixes without testing
❌ Deploying before Phase 1 complete
❌ Skipping security reviews
❌ Ignoring MEDIUM/LOW issues
❌ Poor communication
