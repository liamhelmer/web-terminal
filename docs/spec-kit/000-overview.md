## Project Name

**Web-Terminal** - A modern, browser-based terminal emulator with local execution capabilities

---

## Purpose and Vision

Web-Terminal is a high-performance, browser-based terminal emulator that enables users to execute shell commands directly in their web browser with the power and safety of WebAssembly (WASM). The project bridges the gap between web applications and native terminal functionality, providing a seamless command-line experience accessible from anywhere.

### Core Vision

- **Accessibility**: Terminal access from any modern browser without installation
- **Security**: Sandboxed execution environment leveraging WASM security model
- **Performance**: Native-level execution speed through Rust and WASM compilation
- **Simplicity**: Single-port deployment with relative path constraints for easy setup

## Project Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Deliver a fully functional browser-based terminal** that matches native terminal capabilities
2. **Ensure enterprise-grade security** through WASM sandboxing and process isolation
3. **Achieve sub-100ms command execution latency** for common operations
4. **Support 10,000+ concurrent sessions** on commodity hardware
5. **Maintain 99.9% uptime reliability** in production environments

### Secondary Goals

1. Enable collaborative terminal sessions with real-time sharing
2. Support custom themes and personalization options
3. Provide comprehensive audit logging for compliance requirements
4. Enable plugin/extension ecosystem for community contributions
